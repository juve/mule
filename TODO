Fix get so that it doesn't create cache DB entries when the LFN does not exist
If download fails, then remove entry from cache DB
Make it impossible to update the cache db if the download fails
Allow RLS PFNs to have priorities and return them in priority order
Develop some scheme for ranking PFNs?
Save size of files in cache
Save timestamp of files in cache
Automatically remove files from cache according to a policy
	(e.g. track disk usage and remove oldest file when max reached)
Automatically remove files when they are deleted from RLS?
	(periodically scan files in the cache and remove them if they are not in the RLS)
Figure out security (e.g. prevent the agent from giving access to anyone's files)
