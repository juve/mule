INTRODUCTION

This code implements a bloom filter comparison function
that can be called in a Condor ClassAd expression.

INSTALLATION

To install the library compile it using the makefile
and set the Condor configuration entry:

CLASSAD_LIB_PATH = /path/to/libbloom.so

Then restart Condor.

NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS WITH CONDOR <= 7.4.x.
